# Compose Multiplatform Wallet App

## Development

Development happens in branch `development`. The `main` branch always tracks the latest release. Hence, create PRs against `development`. Use dedicated `release/x.y.z` branches to prepare releases and create release PRs against `main`, which will then be merged back into `development`.

## Local deployments

Building of the Android App locally requires a signer certificate to be configured. To do this you will need to generate a keystore file and add the keystore's password to your `local.properties` file.

> [!NOTE]
> The following instructions are for fine for locally building debug APKs. Inside a CI pipeline, it is highly recommended to use CI secrets that are propagated to environment veriables!

Navigate in a temporary directory and run the following commands to generate a keystore file:

```bash
# Create the Self-Signed Certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt -days 365 -nodes
# Convert to .p12 Format. You will be asked for a password here, remember it!
openssl pkcs12 -export -out keystore.p12 -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -name "key0"
# Move to the android app directory
mv keystore.p12 <path-to-repo>/androidApp/keystore.p12
```

Add the password property (`android.cert.password`) to the `local.properties` file in the root of the project:

```txt
sdk.dir=<path-to-android-sdk>
android.cert.password=<your-keystore-password>
```

## Request Certificate Trust Anchors (demo)

For request certificate validation in demo mode, Android loads trust anchors from:

`shared/src/androidMain/assets/trust/msca-root.pem`

Notes:
- This file is a local trust store input and may contain one or more root certificates.
- Trust anchors are used for chain anchoring only and are not expected in transported `x5c` values.

## Request Certificate Validation (current state)

Valera validates request certificates during authentication-request preparation.

Current flow:
- `RequestCertificateValidator` validates the request `x5c` as WRPAC input when present.
- `WrprcVerifierInfoParser` extracts `registration_cert` entries from `verifier_info`.
- `WrprcVerifierInfoValidator` validates WRPRC header, signature, chain, and required payload claims.
- If no WRPRC is present, `PublicRegistrationInfoLoader` loads signed public `registration-info` from the registrar.
- The resulting payloads are only used to derive UI-facing recipient display data for the consent page.

Current trust inputs:
- request `x5c` from the authentication request
- WRPRC `x5c` from `verifier_info`
- local trust anchors loaded from `shared/src/androidMain/assets/trust/msca-root.pem`

Current registrar fallback inputs:
- public `GET /wrp/{wrpIdentifier}/service?serviceUri=...`
- public `GET /wrp/{wrpIdentifier}/registration-info?serviceUri=...`

This is demo validation logic. It is intentionally kept local to Valera and does not yet model broader lifecycle or revocation handling.

## Deployments

We use [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to build the iOS App. The CI pipeline and secrets on this GitHub repository are already set up correctly. No need to do it again!

Setup:
 - Get an Apple Development Account
 - Create an [App Store Connect API Key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api) (with `App manager` access) and download it
 
Create a new certificate:
 - On your Mac, go to Keychain Access
 - Under Certificates, select the Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority
 - In the menu go to Certificate Assistant, Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority
 - There, enter your mail address, and set "Valera" as the Common Name, and save the CSR to disk
 - On the [Apple developer website](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add), create a certificate for `Apple development` and one for `Apple distribution` with the CSR generated before
 - Import the generated certificates into Keychain Access, to associate them with your key,
 - Select both entries (private key and certificate) and export the two items to a `p12` file again by right clicking on them
 - Use the content of the `p12` file for `APPLE_CERT_CONTENT`
 - Use the password of the `p12` file for `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`

Create provisioning profiles:
 - XCode will register the app identifier automatically for this project
 - Create two provisioning profiles on the [Apple developer website](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/add), one for `iOS App Development` (name it `Compose Wallet Development`) and one for `App Store Connect` (name it `Compose Wallet Distribution`)
 - Be sure to include the necessary entitlements, e.g. associated domains
 - Download the provisioning profiles in XCode and set them for the project, instead of `automatically manage signing`
 - Use `Compose Wallet Development` for debug builds
 - Use `Compose Wallet Distribution` for release builds

Required secrets for GitHub Actions:
- `APPLE_ID` with your Apple Development mail address
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` with the key id from your App Store Connect API Key
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID` with the issuer id from your App Store Connect API Key
- `APPLE_API_KEY_CONTENT` with the Base64-encoded content of the `p8` file from the App Store Connect API Key
- `APPLE_CERT_CONTENT` with the Base64-encoded content of the `p12` certificate you've exported
- `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` with the password of the certificate you've exported

For Android we use a keystore to sign and build the app. The keystore is checked in, the password needs to be set as a environment variable.

Setup:
 - Create a new keystore, e.g. from Android Studio

Required secrets for GitHub Actions:
 - `ANDROID_CERT_PASSWORD` with the password for the keystore you've exported
